UMap is now officially a Spack package.

The submitted package file includes [each release on
GitHub](https://github.com/LLNL/umap/releases) as well as the ability to
build from the latest commit on
[develop](https://github.com/LLNL/umap/tree/develop). It also includes
variants for the `ENABLE_TESTS` and `ENABLE_LOGGING` flags, both defaulting
to `off`.
