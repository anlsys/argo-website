_Data and Thread Placement in NUMA Architectures: A Statistical Learning Approach_ was presented at ICPP 2019.

The paper was presented by Nicolas Denoyelle at the 48th International
Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP 2019) in Kyoto, Japan.

We also added a previously missing paper:

_In Situ Workflows at Exascale: System Software to the Rescue_ was
presented at the Workshop on In Situ Infrastructures for Enabling
Extreme-scale Analysis and Visualization (ISAV 2017), held in conjunction
with SC 2017 in Denver, Colorado, USA.

Both papers are available on our [Publications]({{ site.baseurl
