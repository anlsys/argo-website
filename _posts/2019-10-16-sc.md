A number of activities related to the Argo project and its members will
take place during the upcoming SC conference in Denver, Colorado.

Even before the SC starts, on November 13--15 (Wednesday--Friday), the
[PowerStack
Seminar](https://powerstack.caps.in.tum.de/powerstack-nov19.html) will take
place in the nearby Colorado Springs.

On Sunday, November 17, at 8:30am--12pm, Tapasya Patki will give a half-day
tutorial on [Boosting Power Efficiency of HPC Applications with
GEOPM](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=tut166&sess=sess178).

On Monday, November 18, at 9am--5:30pm, the [Workshop on Memory Centric
High Performance Computing
(MCHPC)](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/session/?sess=sess117) will take
place.  The workshop is co-organized by Maya Gokhale and will include
presentations by [Ivy Peng on
UMap](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=ws_mchpc109&sess=sess117)
and by [Swann Perarnau on
AML](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=ws_mchpc112&sess=sess117).
In parallel, the [Tenth Annual Workshop for the Energy Efficient HPC
Working Group (EE HPC
WG)](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/session/?sess=sess123) will take place
(9am--5:30pm), as will the workshop on the [Containers and New
Orchestration Paradigms for Isolated Environments in HPC (CANOPIE
HPC)](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/session/?sess=sess136) (2pm--5:30pm).

On Tuesday, November 19, at 5:15pm--6:45pm, Pete Beckman, Swann Perarnau,
and Valentin Reis will co-lead a BoF on [Machine-Learning Hardware:
Architecture, System Interfaces, and Programming
Models](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/session/?sess=sess301).  In
parallel, at 5:15pm--7pm, The LLNL PowerStack team will present the poster
[The HPC PowerStack: A Community-wide Collaboration Towards an Energy
Efficient Software
Stack](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=rpost214&sess=sess348)
(also on display throughout the day Tuesday--Thursday).

On Wednesday, November 20, at 12:15pm--1:15pm, Stephanie Brink will co-lead
the BoF on [HPC PowerStack: Community-Driven Collaboration on Power-Aware
System Stack](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/session/?sess=sess340).
