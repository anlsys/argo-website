A number of activities related to the Argo project and its members will
take place during the upcoming SC conference in St. Louis, Missouri and
online.

On Sunday, November 14, from 9am to 5:30pm, the [Workshop on Memory Centric
High Performance Computing
(MCHPC)](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/session/?sess=sess123) will take
place.  The workshop is co-organized by Maya Gokhale.  In parallel, the
workshop on [Containers and New Orchestration Paradigms for Isolated
Environments in HPC
(CANOPIE-HPC)](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/session/?sess=sess427) will
take place.

On Monday, November 15, from 9am to 12:30pm, the [11th International
Workshop on Runtime and Operating Systems for Supercomputers
(ROSS)](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/session/?sess=sess341) will take
place.  The workshop is co-organized by Kamil Iskra.  At 5pm, Nicolas
Denoyelle will present a paper [Narrowing the Search Space of Applications
Mapping on Hierarchical
Topologies](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=ws_pmbsf110&sess=sess422)
at the [12th International Workshop on Performance Modeling, Benchmarking
and Simulation of High-Performance Computer Systems
(PMBS)](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/session/?sess=sess422).  The paper
is available on our [Publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/) page.

On Tuesday, November 16, at 3:30pm--5pm, Maya Gokhale will participate in
the panel [A Precipice of Transformation: Programming Models for Future HPC
Systems](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=pan108&sess=sess226).
At 5:15pm--6:45pm, Kazutomo Yoshii will co-lead a BoF on [Successful FPGA
Programming Methods and Tools for
HPC](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=bof126&sess=sess371).

On Wednesday, November 17, at 5:15pm--6:45pm, Tapasya Patki will co-lead a
BoF on [Community-Driven Efforts for Energy Efficiency in HPC Software
Stack](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=bof163&sess=sess404).

On Friday, November 19, from 8:30am to 12pm, the workshop on [Programming
Environments for Heterogeneous Computing
(PEHC)](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=wksp146&sess=sess109)
will take place.  The workshop is co-organized by Maya Gokhale.  At
