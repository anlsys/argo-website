title: New release of Variorum
---

Variorum v0.6.0 has been released!

New features:

* Support for new architectures: Intel discrete GPUs, AMD GPUs through ROCm-SMI
* Add python wrappers and python module `pyVariorum`

API changes:

* Update JSON APIs to use `char*` instead of `json_t*`
* Creates new `variorum_topology.h` header to expose get topology APIs

Other notable changes:

* `VARIORUM_LOG` moved from a build variable to an environment variable
* Update architecture-related names to be more granular, for example,
  `VARIORUM_WITH_AMD` became `VARIORUM_WITH_AMD_CPU` and
  `VARIORUM_WITH_AMD_GPU`, and `SandyBridge_2A.h` became `Intel_06_2A.h`
* Standardized examples with `-h` and `-v` flags, for printing the help
  menu and Variorum version, respectively
